# Hummingbot Project Management Repository

This repository is used for project management for various initiatives affecting the Hummingbot ecosystem. The main use of this repository is for the Weekly Developer Call, and other future calls.

## Weekly Developer Call

### Purpose

The Weekly Developer Call is technical & general discussion intended to gather active community developers who contribute in making the Hummingbot codebase better through Hummingbot Improvement Proposals (HIPs) and Bug Fixes. 

### **Agendas**

The agendas for the calls are tracked in the Issues tab of this repository, under the “agenda” label ([link](https://github.com/hummingbot/pm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aagenda)). To add an item to an agenda, please open an issue in this repository.

We welcome anyone to add an item to the agenda. These items must be  related to Hummingbot codebase, & Governance / Improvement Proposals.

### Who Can Attend

We are inviting everyone in the community to join the call, including traders, quants/analysts, and newbies. Further, we encourage anyone to also actively participate during these calls by asking questions, voicing out concerns, and openly sharing personal points of view.
